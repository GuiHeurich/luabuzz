This a simple version of the classic FizzBuzz exercise.

### How to use

To install Lua, type the following in your terminal:
```
curl -R -O http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.3.5.tar.gz
tar zxf lua-5.3.5.tar.gz
cd lua-5.3.5
make <linux, macosx, etc> test
make <linux, macosx, etc> install
```
Lua comes with an REPL interpreter that you can access by simply typing ```lua```. (I still haven't figured how to quit the REPL, but you can always do a ctrl+C....:) )

Finally, clone this repo and run ```lua luabuzz.lua``` to see the magic!
