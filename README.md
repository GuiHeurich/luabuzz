### How to use

To install Lua, type the following in your terminal:
```
curl -R -O http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.3.5.tar.gz
tar zxf lua-5.3.5.tar.gz
cd lua-5.3.5
make <linux, macosx, etc> test
make <linux, macosx, etc> install
```

Finally, clone this repo and run ```lua luabuzz.lua``` to see the magic!

## Translation(NEXT STEP)

To use lua2js(https://github.com/mherkender/lua.js), which translates Lua into javaScript and allows you to open it in a browser.
